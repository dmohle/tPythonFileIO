Python Text File Handling Assignment

Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will practice reading and writing text files using Python. Specifically, you will work with the file named arrivingAnimals.txt. Additionally, you will be tasked with modifying the get_species function to handle input errors, particularly for strings with fewer than five words.

Completing this assignment will help prepare you for the upcoming midterm programming assignment, which involves organizing the data from arrivingAnimals.txt into a report with four habitats, one for each of the species.

Assignment Instructions:

1. Text File Handling:
Your first task is to create a Python program that reads and writes to a text file. You should use the file named arrivingAnimals.txt, which is provided in the repository.

2. Modifying get_species Function:
Modify the get_species function to handle input errors gracefully. Currently, the function assumes that there are at least five words in the input string. You should update it to provide a meaningful response when the input string has fewer than five words.

3. Testing and Documentation:
Test your Python program thoroughly with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it behaves as expected. Document any changes you make to the get_species function and how it handles input errors.

4. Commit Your Code:
Commit your Python program and any additional files to this repository.

Submission Guidelines:
Please ensure that your commits are clear and well-documented.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.
Good luck with this assignment! Successfully completing it will help you build the skills necessary for the upcoming midterm programming assignment, where you'll organize the data from arrivingAnimals.txt into a report with four habitats - one for each of the species.
